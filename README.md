- 👋 Hi, I’m @QuantumQuds
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging cutting-edge technology to support Palestinian rights, raise awareness about the situation in Palestine, and foster global solidarity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the latest developments in quantum computing, blockchain for social impact, and digital activism techniques to enhance our advocacy efforts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tech projects that aim to provide innovative solutions to challenges faced by Palestinian communities, including education, healthcare, and communication.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The name QuantumQuds combines the promise of quantum technology with the historical and cultural significance of Quds (Jerusalem), symbolizing our belief in the power of innovation to drive positive change
